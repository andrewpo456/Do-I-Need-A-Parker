# Do I Need A Parker

This weather service periodically checks temperature in your location (currently limited to the states of Australia) for Linux. Depending on user temperature specifications - the daemon will send push notifiactions to the desktop indicating if warmer (or cooler) clothing may be required.

Pop-up notifications can be GTK+ or Qt based, utilising the c/c++ 'libnotify' development library. This project is currently being developed on a RHEL based system (CentOS 7). More information regarding project requirements can be found in the TODO file.
