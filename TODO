Do I Need a Parker daemon : 'dinapd'

- Will need a config file that has user location data, and preferred temperatures.

- Daemon init scripts

- The actual daemon itself
	- That will 'wake-up' every hour and scrape weather information from some online source. For now we will limit this to state capitals in australia.
	- Will push notifications to the desktop about 'parker' updates.
	- The daemon will be passed the location and temp data from the Daemon init script. This means that it will need to be restarted everytime changes are made to the config file.

- GUI app to change the config file/choose weather location/choose temp?
